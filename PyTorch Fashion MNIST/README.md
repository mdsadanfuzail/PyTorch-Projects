# Fashion MNIST PyTorch

* This project involves building a simple neural network to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset contains 10 categories of clothing and accessories.

* I have used Pytorch for this project, and also this is with some of the **Regularisation techniques**.

### Regularisation techniques:
1. Data Augmentation

2. Batch Normalisation

3. Dropout

### Regularisation Tips:
* It is Always good to train a model without Regularisation first and get a baseline for the model.

* Next you can use Regularisation techniques in order or one by one to improve model performance.
